# Heart Journey | An Interactive Web Experience

This is a small and heartfelt project made using basic web tools — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s meant to be fun, emotional, and a little playful. You go through different "stages" by clicking on hearts, and each click brings something new.

## What It Does

- Starts with a heart you have to click quickly.
- If you're too fast… the heart breaks.
- Try to fix it, and you’re rewarded.
- A final message and surprise await at the end.

The whole experience plays out like a mini love story. It was built from scratch using just code — no fancy frameworks or libraries.

## Built With

- HTML for structure
- CSS for colors, animations, and layout
- JavaScript for handling clicks and interactions

## How to Use It

1. Download the files.
2. Keep all the images and fonts in the same folder.
3. Open `Cindex.html` in your browser.
4. That’s it. Click and enjoy.

## Why I Made This

Sometimes you just want to build something sweet — no logic puzzles, no heavy data. Just vibes. This was my way of mixing feelings and creativity with code. It’s simple, maybe even silly, but it means something to me.

Thanks for checking it out.
